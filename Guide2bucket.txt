A) How to add new templates to the gene pages? 

Introducing new templates is easy, just edit the hook_theme and hook_node_view functions to reflect the details of the new template file. Then add the template file under theme/templates/ 

In case of tripal_gene, the description template was added as follows: 

tripal_gene.module
====================

function tripal_gene_theme($existing, $type, $theme, $path) {
  $core_path = drupal_get_path('module', 'tripal_core');

  $items = array(
    'node__chado_gene' => array(
      'template' => 'node--chado-generic',
      'render element' => 'node',
      'base hook' => 'node',
      'path' => "$core_path/theme/templates",
    ),
    'tripal_gene_description' => array(
      'variables' => array('node' => NULL),
      'template' => 'tripal_gene_description',
      'path' => "$path/theme/templates",
    ),
  );

  return $items;
}

./includes/tripal_gene.chado_node.inc
=======================================

function tripal_gene_node_view($node, $view_mode, $langcode) {
  switch ($node->type) {
    case 'chado_feature':
      // Show feature browser and counts
      if ($view_mode == 'full') {
        $node->content['tripal_gene_description'] = array(
          '#markup' => theme('tripal_gene_description', array('node' => $node)),
          '#tripal_toc_id'    => 'description',
          '#tripal_toc_title' => 'description',
          '#weight' => -100,
        );
      }
      break;
  }
}

Note: '#weight' holds the template position in the block. 

You can refer to the tripal_gene_description.tpl.php file under /theme/templates/ . 
Tripal recommends using functions like chado_expand_variable or chado_get_var to query the database.
PHP/drupal might throw white screen if the query size is large, this is mostly due to recursive query error (memory error) and it could be avoided usingthe above described functions. 


B) How to add bucket or selection functionality in tripal/drupal?

The bucket functionality was introduced using the following resources:

1) Lightshop drupal module

2) https://www.drupal.org/node/1517916 (Covers rendering of view rows and selection options on view)

I had issues with lightshop module especially with installation and access/permission across module, so lighshop was used for its ajax functionality. 
Please feel free to visit the drupal page for lightshop for new releases.

The bucket can be implemented for both Mview's and chado tables, at NCGR the bucket is implemented on the gene Mview.(Details about Mview could be found in the tripal_example module).

The bucket based selection requires implementation of the hook_views_data, hooks_views_data_alter and the handler code, please see the views folder of the tripal_gene module for reference. 

Next important thing is implementing the hook_menu for pages that will display the bucket selections, a form api can be implemented for further data processing and analysis.
